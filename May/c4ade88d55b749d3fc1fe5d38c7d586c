Online retail in South Africa more than doubled in just two years, thanks to the explosion in demand for home deliveries brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, according to new research findings released today.



Online Retail in South Africa
2021, a study conducted by World Wide Worx with the support of Mastercard,
Standard Bank and Platinum Seed, reveals that the total growth for online
retail in South Africa in 2020 came to 66%, bringing the total of online retail
in South Africa to R30,2-billion.



“The most astonishing aspect
of this total is that it is more than double the R14,1-billion reached in 2018,
in just two years,” says World Wide Worx MD Arthur Goldstuck, principal analyst
on the research project. “It is also 50% higher than the total forecast for
2020 three years ago, when online retail in South Africa was expected to reach
R20-billion by 2020.”



The figure comes into most
dramatic context when it is compared to traditional retail. In 2018, the
R14,1-billion in online retail represented 1.4% of total retail, estimated at
the time at R1,07-trillion. Online had outpaced traditional retail growth
throughout the past 20 years, since it came off a low base, but traditional
retail still grew every year until 2019. In 2020, it slumped as a result of
lockdown as well as economic stress. 



According to preliminary data
from Stats SA shows, at current prices, total retail fell by 4.2%, to
R1,05-trillion at current prices. The percentage of retail made up by online
retail sales came to 2.8% – exactly double the percentage for 2018.



“While equivalent growth
cannot be expected for 2021, it can be stated fairly confidently that it will
exceed the 30% growth of 2019, when expansion was organic and a factor of the
evolution of shopping habits and retail strategies,” says Goldstuck. “Those
factors remain in place, along with the massive boost given to both areas of
evolution since the pandemic began.”



This means we can expect to
see total online retail sales of around R42-billion in 2021, taking the online
percentage of total retail to around 4%, assuming traditional retail returns to
its previous growth path.



The findings were not a
surprise. Already in November 2020, Mastercard released the findings of a
survey of 1,000 South African consumers, which found that 68% of respondents
were shopping more online since the onset of the pandemic.



The categories experiencing
the highest growth, aside from data and airtime top-up, were clothing, at 56%,
and groceries, at 54%. 



More than two-thirds – 68% –
of these consumers said they used the time during the pandemic as a positive
learning experience, while the demand for online entertainment also surged,
with 52% of respondents saying they have spent more money on virtual
experiences than they did before the pandemic. The majority had participated in
video calls for work or leisure (88%), three quarters (75%) had watched TV or
films through an online subscription service, and nearly half (47%) had taken
part in a virtual cooking class.



“This trend appears to be
here to stay as 71% of respondents say they will continue to shop online
post-pandemic,” says Suzanne Morel, Country Manager at Mastercard, South
Africa. “Now more than ever people need access to the digital economy and all
of us at Mastercard are constantly working to make the online shopping
experience more inclusive, simple, seamless and secure for everyone, whether
you’re shopping for essentials or experiences.”



The study is being released
in three phases, with the first focused on overall market size and online
consumer demographics. The first report is based on data drawn from the TGI consumer
survey of 16,000 participants, conducted by Ask Afrika over six months.



Subsequent phases of Online
Retail in South Africa 2021, to be released later in the year, will include an
analysis of the performance of online retailers, based on a survey of a wide
range of providers, while the third phase will provide deep insights into
global trends.
